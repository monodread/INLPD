// How to record with SuperCollider:

// this command runs recording on the current server:

s.record; // start recording
s.stopRecording; // stops recording

// if you are working in the IDE you can make a window for the server:
s.makeWindow;

// All recordings are put into the home folder:
e.g. /Users/jasminemoniqueguffond/Music/SuperCollider Recordings/
